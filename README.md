 Proof of concept immersive VR application to promote transgender inclusion within the police

This application formed the final year project submitted to the University of Salford.

The project aim was to develop a proof-of-concept VR application to aid in promoting inclusivity by improving empathy towards transgender people for use in Greater Manchester Police training programs. This was achieved by developing an immersive VR simulation which enabled users to experience the discrimination transgender people endure and demonstrate the lack of support they receive. Using VR to provide the opportunity to experience these scenarios from the victim’s perspective aims to generate empathy towards the transgender community and hence improve the service the police provide.

The application was developed in Unity using the OpenXR plugin to enable a wide variety of devices to be targeted. This was deployed and tested on the Meta Quest 2 headset. 

A recording of the simulation can be found in the repository ‘Simulation_Recording.mp4’, this demonstrates the main interactions of the simulation (main menu and tutorial details are not included in this demonstration).
